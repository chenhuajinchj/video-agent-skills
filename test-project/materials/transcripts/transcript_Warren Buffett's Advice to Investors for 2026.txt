If you're emotional about investments,
you're not going to do well. I mean,
facts are facts and reason is reason. In
investing, there are no call strikes. I
can look at a thousand different
companies. And I don't have to be right
on every one of them or even 50 of them
or even 25 of them.
>> That's Warren Buffett, arguably the
world's greatest investor. Since taking
control of Berkshire Hathway in 1965
until now, the stock has averaged 20%
returns per year. That's double the
return of the S&P 500 each year, which
over time has added up to a 5.5 million%
return for Buffett versus 39,000% for
the S&P 500. So, in this video, we're
going to hear some of Warren Buffett's
advice specifically for this investing
market at the end of 2025 and going into
2026. So, what is that? Well, we're
seeing AI stocks hit record valuations
with Nvidia alone, now worth more than
all the major banks in the US and Canada
combined. US debt, both private and
governmental, is rising exponentially
with some investors now worrying about
the future of the US dollar, especially
in the face of new competition from
China and BRICS countries. And throw in
the potential of a full-on market
correction. With the S&P 500 now more
concentrated than ever in just a few
stocks, it makes sense investors are
feeling kind of stressed about the
future. So, let's walk through the four
indicators the US market might be
overvalued today, as well as Warren
Buffett's four pieces of advice for us
as rational long-term investors in a
market that's been behaving erratically
to say the least. So, the first worrying
sign that investors are seeing in the
market is an increasing amount of stocks
being bought using debt. This chart
shows how stocks bought using borrowed
money has been outpacing the growth of
the broader market over the past 30
years. Meaning more and more of the
market's current value is just built on
debt that people are borrowing. So, I
covered this and how it could lead to
what Buffett calls a potential loss
decade in stocks in a previous video.
But in addition to leveraging themselves
to buy stocks, we're also seeing an
economy where more and more debt is
being taken on to fund lifestyles as
well due to high inflation and rising
costs that just makes it harder to
afford living. And that whole situation
is rightly concerning to Buffett because
he's actually warned about using debt to
buy stocks in the past.
>> Anything can happen in markets. I mean,
anything can happen to markets. That's
why they don't ever borrow money against
securities. So the big concern here is
that more debt is being used to
artificially inflate prices in the
market. There's more money in there than
there should be and that could
contribute to stocks hitting
unsustainable valuations and to the
increase in volatility that we've seen
in the market. Basically how much the
market has been bouncing up and down.
This is the VIX index and it tracks the
expected volatility of the S&P 500 and
it has spiked by over 30% in the past
month, showing signs that people don't
expect the market to calm down anytime
soon. So, in addition to debt, we'll see
three more warning signs about the
market's current valuations. But first,
let's look at Buffett's first rule and
how it applies to this market.
>> I look to the business to determine
whether I made a good investment. It's
the business I look at. When you're just
looking at the price of something,
you're not investing.
>> So that's Buffett's first rule of
investing. Focus on buying a business
rather than a stock. Whenever we see
markets run up to an unreasonable price,
it always follows the same pattern. It's
investors looking to buy a stock and
then flip it at a higher price. They
don't really care what the fundamental
company underneath that stock is worth.
They're just looking to make a quick
profit. Because if you haven't studied
the fundamental business, it's very hard
to tell if a stock is overvalued or not.
So, what can we take away from this
advice? Well, if the market is
overvalued and we do see a pullback in
stocks, there are certain types of
businesses that will tend to perform
well no matter what the overall economy
is doing. Companies selling necessities
like medicine, groceries, utilities,
your phone. These are called defensive
stocks. And as a group, they tend to
outperform when the rest of the market
is down because they're businesses that
operate in areas that people don't tend
to cut back on. So that's at an industry
level, but specific stocks can still
rise or fall based on their business.
And so Buffett also has some advice
here, and he uses a really good analogy
that he actually borrowed from his
longtime mentor Benjamin Graham. And
it's a way to make it easier to think
about stocks like a business. Imagine
you have a business partner named Mr.
Market in a business where you own a
small share for $1,000. Mr. Market is
very obliging. He's also a little manic
depressive. So every other day he tells
you what he thinks your little business
is worth and offers to either buy you
out or sell you more of the business.
Sometimes his offer seems reasonable
based on what the business is doing. And
sometimes Mr. Market lets his enthusiasm
or fear run away with him and he offers
you some silly prices. Mr. Market is
like the stock market and we're like the
business owner. We get to decide if we
think Mr. market is charging too much or
if he's offering stocks at a discount.
And we get to pick and choose the
specific businesses that are at a price
that we think is reasonable. But how do
we determine if it's a reasonable price?
Well, let's look at the second warning
sign in the market. And then we'll get
to Buffett's second rule of investing
that answers that question. But that
leads us to a much more immediate
warning sign in the market. One that
Buffett has been issuing increasingly
strong warnings about. And to show you
this visually and in fact throughout
this entire video, I've been using Story
Blocks, who has been kind enough to
sponsor this video. So, check this out.
If I type China map, for one set price,
you can get access to all of these
assets. I think there's over a million
assets on Story Blocks, and you can
download as many as you want. I like to
just download tons of these for my
videos, and then later decide what looks
best in the video. So, the stuff I use
gets put in, the stuff I don't doesn't,
and I don't pay any extra for that. But
more than footage, my editor and I
actually use templates like all the time
in these videos, like transitions, this
animated text. So, I'm not an animator,
but I can use these cool, useful
graphics to make the video feel way more
premium without designing all the
graphics from scratch. So, I've been
using Story Blocks since early 2024,
basically as long as I've been trying to
make these videos look good. So, way
before they reached out about sponsoring
a video, because it's just the best
option for high-quality assets at a
pretty cheap price. It's just one price
either monthly or annually. No extra
fees, no licensing, and it makes the
videos so much better and so much
faster. It's like one of the best ROI
tools that I've paid for on this
channel. So, there's a link in the

let's see the second warning sign in the
market and how Buffett's second rule of
investing can help us follow the
long-term rational path. So on top of
the high leverage in the market, we're
also seeing a second risk that could be
contributing to overvaluation,
concentration risk.
So here's the official definition of
concentration risk. When your portfolio
is too focused on one type of
investment, it can make you lose a bunch
of money if that investment goes down.
It's like those group projects in school
where just one or two people do all the
work. Ask me how I know. And if just
those few people stop working, well, the
entire project can fall apart. That's
kind of like what's happening in the S&P
500 right now. A huge chunk of the S&P's
recent growth has been driven by just a
few huge tech companies. Apple, Amazon,
Nvidia. According to Goldman Sachs, the
top 10 companies in the S&P 500 now make
up a third of the index's value. that's
even more concentrated than during the
dotcom bubble in 2000. So now if those
few companies run into trouble, that can
drag down the entire S&P 500, even if
the other 490 companies are doing fine.
And this is also why the S&P 500's PE
ratio, which measures the average
stock's price versus the average profits
US companies are making. That PE ratio
is now sitting at over 30. The last time
it was this high was before the 2021
market correction and before that was
2008. Historically, the S&P 500 trades
at a PE ratio between 16 and 20. So
today, it would take a 50% drop to reach
those same prices. And a lot of that
recent rise in price is driven by AI and
tech companies. Now look, I'm not saying
that AI or technology is not creating
value. It clearly is. I'm personally
very invested in a lot of tech stocks,
but I think Buffett's second rule of
investing really shows the difference
here. So, let me share an analogy from
Buffett that I think about anytime a new
technology starts to gain traction in
the market.
>> I given talks in the past where I carry
with me a 70page tightly printed list
and it shows 2,000 auto companies. Now,
if at the start of the 20th century, you
had seen what the auto was going to do
to this country, the impact it would
have, but if those 2,000 companies,
three basically survive, so how do you
pick three winners out of 20,000? I
mean, it's not so easy to do it.
>> Buffett here makes the analogy that any
new technology is like the car in 1905.
And he gave this talk around the time of
the dot bubble, by the way. So you might
realize that a technology is going to
change the world like the car did. But
you need another level of experience to
understand which company is going to win
out in that new technology. And
Buffett's fix for this is fairly simple.
Defining your circle of competence is
the most important aspect of investing.
You don't have to be an expert on
everything, but knowing where the
perimeter of that circle of what you
know and what you don't know is and
staying inside of it is all important.
investing only within your circle of
competence, the area of the market that
you know best and that you have
experience in. It's like if you ask me
to fix a boat. I don't know anything
about boats. I grew up in the mountains.
I can help you fix your cloud computing.
And if you ask a boat mechanic the
opposite, well, he can run circles
around me with engines, but he probably
can't fix networking. And it's the same
in investing. You don't have to be an
expert in everything, and you don't have
to invest in every trend. So before
buying a stock, you can ask yourself, am
I really an expert in this area? Do I
know how AI works, how companies are
using it, and how it's creating value?
If yes, then you can probably spot deals
in stocks in the market. But if not,
it's easy to just get swept up with the
crowd that is just buying whatever the
hot new thing is. And that is a really
important lesson that I've had to learn
time and time again. But okay, even if
you stick to industries in your circle
of competence and you look at the
company as a business, you can still get
hurt by an overall falling market. So,
let's now look at the third warning sign
in the market. And this one is very
Buffett specific. And then we'll look at
the third rule that comes from Buffett's
partner, Charlie Munger, and it's one
that I find using myself probably the
most in my life. And sorry about my
voice. There's a cold that's been going
around kind of hitting everybody. And I
really wanted to film this video this
month. and let me know what you think of
the style of this video as well,
ignoring my almost gone voice. So,
number three, well, back in 1998,
Buffett issued a famous warning that the
US was headed for a lost decade in
stocks, where the market wouldn't have
any meaningful return for the first 10
years of the early 2000s. And that
prediction ended up being right. The
market went on to have an annualized
return of only 2% from 2000 through
2012, which is less than inflation. And
that happened because the.com bubble
burst and it took years for the market
to recover. In the years that followed,
it kind of seemed miraculous that
Buffett had called this prediction when
the rest of the market got it so wrong.
But then in 2001, he revealed an
indicator, basically a single number
that investors could look at to
determine if the market was overvalued
or not. He called the indicator probably
the best single measure of where
valuations stand at any given moment.
Though he did walk that quote back a
little bit later, it still became known
as the Buffett indicator, which looks
like this and can act as one data point
for how expensive the market currently
is. It may look a little bit mathy, but
the core idea is really simple. Take the
total value of all US stocks and divide
that by the total production of the
United States, GDP. That's it. It's a
way to see how much people are paying
for companies compared to how much they
actually produce, which makes it a very
tangible indicator, not just based on
numbers on a spreadsheet. And while this
isn't the be all end all of indicators
that will tell us exactly when a market
will crash, it's still a useful data
point that can give us a temperature on
the situation. And this indicator is
flashing a warning light. This is a
chart in the trend of the Buffett
indicator over time. This historical
trend line is sort of the average growth
that we've seen historically. In 2020,
the market passed one standard deviation
above that line, and today we're sitting
more than two standard deviations above
it. Meaning, it's now 69% higher than we
would expect from historical data. And
considering we've never sustained that
level of deviation for more than 6
months without seeing a market
correction, it's a useful data point to
understand how expensive the market
currently is. So, how do we deal with
this? We can't just focus on finding
great companies because in a market
downturn, the indexes tend to group
everything together and pull it down all
at once. So, even a really good company
can drop. And this is where Buffett's
third rule of investing comes in. And
it's one that you can really apply in a
lot of different areas of life. But
let's hear it in Buffett's words.
>> Obviously, if you understood a business
perfectly, future of a business, you
would need very little in the way of a
margin of safety. The more volatile the
business is or possibility is, the
larger the margin of safety.
>> A margin of safety, basically some
buffer between the value of something
and the price we pay. And Buffett gives
a good analogy for how we should scale
this margin of safety depending on what
we're investing in.
>> If you're driving a truck across a
bridge, it says it holds 10,000 lb and
you've got a 9,800 lb vehicle. You know,
if the bridge is about 6 in above the
crevice that it covers, you may feel
okay. But if it if it's, you know, over
the Grand Canyon, you may feel you want
a little larger margin of safety.
>> So, it's the same with buying stocks in
this market. If you're buying a
defensive stock like a utility, you
might need a smaller margin of safety
than if you're buying a highly risky
stock like maybe a high-flying AI
player. A utility stock is like driving
a truck over a low bridge, while certain
AI stocks might be like driving a truck
over a bridge over the Grand Canyon. The
consequences of failure are just much
higher. But I think this advice also
applies to today's market in general
because if we do see a market crash,
there's very little chance that we can
time it, meaning selling out before the
dip and then buying back in later. It
sounds easy, but in practice, it just
doesn't work consistently. Here are
three separate studies which I'll share
in the description. All of which show
that holding through a market dip
outperforms trying to trade in and out.
So, if we need to plan to hold through a
market dip, then we need to build in a
margin of safety into our portfolios so
that we can ride through the many
temporary downturns that someone like
Buffett has seen over the course of his
career so that we can survive as
long-term investors and get that
compounding growth of the market over
time. So, let's look at the fourth
warning sign in the market as well as
Buffett's fourth rule. But, I've always
appreciated how plain spoken Buffett is
about everything. He doesn't try to make
things sound complicated to sell you
some story. And that's an example that I
try to follow on this channel. We're on
a quest right now to pass the mly fool
in YouTube subscribers and try to change
the way people talk about stocks. Just
show the data, keep it simple, and stick
to time- tested wisdom. That's what I'm
trying to do on this channel. So, if you
want to help out, thank you. I
appreciate every single one of you who
subscribes. And now, let's take a look
at the fourth warning sign and Buffett's
fourth rule of investing. So, this next
warning sign is actually way more
specific to retail investors, which is
basically Wall Street's name for normal
investors buying stocks. Basically, me
and you investing in the market. Well,
this chart shows retail investors
interest in the riskier forms of
trading, day trading, options, swing
trading. We've seen a big spike
recently, and this has corresponded with
an equally large rise in the amount of
cash that is sitting on the sidelines of
the market. basically disposable income
that people could throw into stocks. And
historically, we see this type of
activity before a market correction
because it's an indicator that people
are playing the market as a short-term
game rather than holding as long-term
investors. Now, I'm not here to tell
anyone they shouldn't use advanced tools
like options if they know what they're
doing. And even though 90% of traders
lose money, there are some who do okay.
But Buffett takes a different approach
in his fourth rule. And as he likes to
do, he explains this one in an analogy.
This clip comes from an old DVD from
like 2004, so the footage is a little
bit grainy, but the wisdom Buffett
shares is still timeless.
>> If you have five good ideas in your
lifetime to get very rich. I tell
students sometime they'd be better off
if they had a punch card when they got
out of school with only 20 punches on it
because then instead of listening to
somebody at a cocktail party and then
going out the next morning and buying
some shares, they'd really think about
every punch. 20 punches is plenty.
>> The idea goes that if you could only buy
20 stocks in your entire life and once
you've used those up, that's it. You
can't buy anymore. Well, we would be so
much more careful about which stocks
that we buy. And that rule to minimize
activity is a lesson that applies just
as well today as it did then. As Buffett
wrote in his 1983 letter to
shareholders, a hyperactive stock market
is the pickpocket of enterprise. There's
this famous story about a study at
Fidelity. It's apocryphal as far as I
can tell, but the lesson is still really
useful. So, the story goes that Fidelity
set out to figure out what is the type
of investor that performs the best in
the stock market. So they looked at all
their investor accounts across the
entire company and found that the second
best performing investors were people
who forgot that they had accounts at
Fidelity. But the best type of investor
were dead. So sometimes it's not about
doing more. It's about making a good
investing decision and then just
forgetting about it for a very very long
time. And if this was valuable to you, I
also made a video on Berkshire Hathway's
latest trades and what they tell us
about how Buffett views today's stock
market. So, you can check that out by
