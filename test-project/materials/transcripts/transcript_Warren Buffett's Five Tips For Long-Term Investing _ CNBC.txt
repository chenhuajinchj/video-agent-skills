I never know what markets are going to
[Music]
do I I know what markets are going to do
over a long period of time they're going
to go up but uh in terms of what's going
to happen in a day or a week or a month
or a year even i' never felt that I knew
it and I've never felt it was important
we're almost always a buyer of stocks
and we're a more aggressive buyer when
they're going down I mean I I feel much
better when they're going down I think
every business should be run as
efficiently as possible and some are and
some aren't we try to buy the ones that
are I I bought my first stock in April
of 1942 I was 11 Pearl Harbor had
happened three or four months earlier we
were losing the War I mean you want to
talk about a bad outlook for the country
the country is not going to go away the
plants aren't going to go away the
people aren't going to go away the
talents aren't going to go away the
country will grow in value over time now
who gets it is another question but hey
