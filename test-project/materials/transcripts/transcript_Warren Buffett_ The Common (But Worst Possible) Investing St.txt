the market is there to serve you and not
to instruct you. That's of enormous
importance. When people talk about
momentum in stocks or or charting or any
kind of things like that, they're saying
that the market is instructing you. The
market doesn't instruct us. The market
is there to serve us. If it does
something silly, we get a chance to do
something because it's doing something
silly, we do it. But it doesn't tell us
anything. It just tells us prices. And
if the price is out of line where the
facts and reasoning lead you, then you
then action is called for. And if it
doesn't, you forget it and you know, go
play bridge that day and the next day
see whether there's something new. And
the nice thing about it is there always
is something new. I mentioned the LTCM
crisis. You know, we on Sunday from
people that had portfolios that were in
trouble. Now, I will tell you that if
you can make a lot of money on Sunday,
you may not get a chance very often, but
any calls you get on Sunday, you're
probably going to make money on things
are things are really screwed up if
you're getting calls on Sunday. And all
you have to do is make sure that you're
the call and not the caller on Sunday.
And and but if you get those calls, you
get a call on a Sunday and somebody says
that the off the run is trading 30 basis
points away from the on the run, you
know, all you have to do is decide
whether how you handle that particular
piece of information, whether it's
correct in the first place, but how you
handle that piece of information,
whether you can play out your hand. You
never get in a position obviously where
the other fellow can call your tune. You
have to be able to play out your hand
under all circumstances. But if you can
play out your hand and you've got the
right facts and you reason by yourself
and you let the market serve you and not
instruct you, you can't miss. Charlie,
well, I would say some of you probably
can miss.
I would say Charlie can't miss. I'll put
it that way. You'll agree with that.
You've so eloquently stated that you
can't see who's swimming naked until the
tide goes out. Could you discuss the
issue of trying to employ a rational
decision-making process in investing or
in business generally as opposed to
focusing on outcomes or results of just
a few instances or over a short period
of time? For example, it may not be a
good idea to underwrite some insurance
policies if competition has lowered the
premiums too far. And likewise, in the
stock market, momentum investors may get
good results for a while, but buying
high and trying to sell higher isn't a
good long-term strategy. So, I just like
to hear you guys provide some detail on
the importance of using an effective
decision-making process even though it
may lead to some bad outcomes and
underperformance in the short run. Yeah.
Well, Ben Graham said long ago that
you're neither right nor wrong because
people agree with you or disagree with
you. In other words, being being
contrarian has no special virtue over
being a trend follower.
You're right because your facts and
reasoning are right. So all you do is
you try to make sure that the facts you
have are correct. And that's usually
pretty easy to do in this country. I
mean the information is available on all
kinds of things. Internet makes it even
easier. And then once you have the
facts, you got to think through what
they mean. And you don't take a public
opinion survey. You don't pay attention
to things that are unimportant. I mean,
what you're looking for is something
things that are important and knowable.
If something's important but unknowable,
forget it. I mean, it may be important,
you know, to know whether somebody's
going to drop a a nuclear weapon
tomorrow, but it's unknowable. It may be
import all kinds of things, but so you f
and there are all kinds of things that
are knowable but are unimportant. In
focusing on business and investment
decisions, you try to think you you
narrow it down to the things that are
knowable and important and then you
decide whether you have information of
sufficient value that you know compared
to price and all that that will cause
you to act. What others are doing
means nothing. It's price and all that
that will cause you to act. What others
are doing
means nothing. Jeremy Seagull had some
ideas in his second book and I would
like to understand what how this would
impact your investment strategies
um if there are any changes from his
ideas and um how you react to these
recommendations that he makes. Thank
you.
>> This is which book? Jeremy Spiegel.
>> Jeremy Seagull the second book by the
try and the true triumph over the old
and the new. Now that that has had no
effect on on us, Charlie,
>> no. Is that the fellow who is very
optimistic about common stock investment
over long periods of time?
>> The University of Pennsylvania.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. Well, I think he's demented.
[Applause]
Well,
he's a he's a very nice guy, Charlie.
Well, he
he he may well be a very nice guy, but
he's comparing apples against elephants
and trying to make
accurate projections.
Number
10.
The one thing we haven't done is we
haven't we haven't participated in any
auctions. Uh I get books occasionally. I
on on various businesses
and the projections are just plain silly
in these books. I mean, it uh is it
I would I would I maybe that's why they
don't sign their names in the books, the
people that write them, because they'd
be embarrassed about the projections
they put forth. Uh I would just love to
meet the people that write those
investment banking books and make them a
bet on the earnings that they project
four years out. I would win a lot of
money over time that they wouldn't be
met. But we
we get the calls occasionally from the
people that care about where their
businesses end up. We're we're going to
close on applied underwriters in just a
probably a few days. And those are two
terrific guys. Build it up from
absolutely nothing. Uh actually bought a
tiny business here in Al, as I explained
in the report, it's why it's here. But
they wanted to come with Bergkshire.
They think their own they're keeping 19%
of the company. They think their own
future will be the best in many ways
including financially. I'm sure that uh
of of being associated with us. They
feel it's the best place for the people
have the most opportunity to grow and
you know they came to us directly to you
know I don't know how many stories you
read about a $4 billion deal as appeared
today in connection with this car where
you know it doesn't say anything about
an investment banker uh on either side
but but uh uh you'll see more of those I
think with Bergkshire over the years.
Charlie, do you have anything particular
to add on our acquisitions recently?
>> Well, the interesting thing about it to
me is the mindset
with all of these new helpers in the
world.
They talk about doing deals. That is not
the mindset
at at Berkshire where we are trying to
welcome partners.
It's a totally different mindset. the
guy who's doing a deal, he wants to do
the deal and unwind the deal and not too
far ahead and make a large profit, etc.
And that's not our mindset at all.
We like the things that we can buy and
that never leave us. And we like the
relationships that last and are
fruitful, not just for us, but for the
people working there and the customers
and everybody else. I think our system
is going to work better
long term than flipping a lot of deals.
And we have so many new deal flippers in
the game that I think they're going to
get in one another's way. In other
words, I don't think there's enough
money out there to have all this new
class make all the money they expect to
make on a permanent basis just flipping,
flipping, flipping, flipping.
>> They'll make it on fees, fees, fees,
fees. So Warren reminds me once I asked
a man who just left a large investment
bank and I said, "How does your firm
make its money?" He said, "Off the top,
off the bottom, off both sides, and in
the middle."
>> I know which firm he's talking about,
too.
>> That's not our culture. And a lot of you
have been here so long, you can see
that's not our culture. But in the end,
it may be that Omaha will do better than
Wall Street.
>> Number five.
