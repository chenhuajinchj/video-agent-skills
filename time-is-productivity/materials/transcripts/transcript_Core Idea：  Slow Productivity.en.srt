2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,480
uh the core idea i want to talk about

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,679
today

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,759
is the following question

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,200
is slow productivity

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,520
the solution

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,720
to burnout

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,320
so slow productivity is a emerging topic

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,760
of thought we've been talking about more

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,760
and more frequently

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,359
and i want to get into it with this core

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,840
idea

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,760
all right let's give some

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,640
background to where the concept of slow

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,520
productivity came from what motivated it

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,680
we are in a moment right now

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,719
in which there is a

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,840
popular and visible pushback against the

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,440
general notion of productivity

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,920
and by productivity i mean just the

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,039
general drive to try to get more things

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,879
done

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,199
now i think the coronavirus pandemic

24
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,680
helped amplify this but this movement

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,600
predates the coronavirus pandemic if

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,000
we're going to use books

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,640
as a rough proxy for cultural thinking

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,799
on this topic we can really look to 2019

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,119
february of 2019 when ginny odell

30
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,960
published how to do nothing

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,640
this book probably helped spark more

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,880
than anything else this

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,000
modern moment of anti-productivity

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,600
thinking

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,720
it was a popular book a new york times

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,880
bestseller

37
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,560
barack obama selected it as one of his

38
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,960
best books of the year

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,000
it opened the floodgates to multiple

40
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,240
other books along these same lines

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
so we got celeste headley's do nothing

42
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,840
that came out soon after

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,600
i actually interviewed celeste for a new

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,680
yorker piece this fall

45
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,119
got a little bit deeper into this we

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,119
also got devin price had a book called

47
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,119
laziness does not exist i blurbed that

48
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,920
book it was a good book helen ann

49
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,720
peterson had can't even

50
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,479
the

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,200
book length treatment of her viral

52
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,680
buzzfeed article about millennial

53
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,759
burnout uh more recently we have oliver

54
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,439
berkman had four thousand weeks which i

55
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,719
blurbed that book as well it's fantastic

56
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,320
that book's really been killing it so

57
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,479
there's been this long string of books

58
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,759
since 2019 that are all basically making

59
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,800
the same point

60
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,879
we're burnt out we're doing too much

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,720
we're tired of doing too much

62
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,040
i saw this anti-productivity movement

63
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,120
even among you my listeners and readers

64
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,440
in 2020 i wrote an essay from my

65
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,680
newsletter about this asking

66
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,800
is the term productivity

67
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,640
over

68
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,640
do we need something new

69
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,879
and it led to a really heated discussion

70
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,400
and two subsequent follow-up posts we

71
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,879
had a lot of back and forth discussion

72
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,640
on this in the spring of 2020 that made

73
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,440
it clear that there are a lot of you out

74
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,160
there

75
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,879
that are just exhausted

76
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,640
exhausted with activity and work

77
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,400
your life outside of work

78
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,920
and need something more than just

79
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,599
falling back on how do i get more done

80
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,000
all right so that is the the modern

81
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,400
anti-productivity movement

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,360
here's the issue

83
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,959
the question left unanswered in a lot of

84
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,920
this work

85
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,360
is what should we do about it

86
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,879
we all agree

87
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,080
these books are doing well because we

88
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,000
all feel

89
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,319
exhausted but the question is what

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,400
should we do about it and my

91
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,120
opinion here is that we haven't had a

92
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,200
lot of fully featured answers the

93
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,800
typical response that we will get to

94
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,680
what we should do about it is basically

95
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,400
just

96
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,799
do less and be okay about that

97
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,959
which is perfectly fine advice but is

98
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,280
not in itself i think a fully fledged

99
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,640
solution to this issue of burnout now we

100
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,000
get this advice from many different

101
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,680
angles some of those books i talked

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,840
about before come at this from an

103
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,959
economic materialist standpoint they say

104
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,080
well you're doing a lot of things

105
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,440
because essentially you're being

106
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,760
exploited by

107
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,640
the capitalist superstructure and so

108
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,799
it's an act of political resistance

109
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,239
to not do something do nothing as a as

110
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,920
an act of political resistance some of

111
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,360
these books are more cultural just we

112
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,519
have a cultural

113
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,920
a culture of overproduction

114
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,159
maybe it goes back to the protestant

115
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,159
work ethic or whatever

116
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,439
and we just need to defy that culture as

117
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,040
an arbitrary culture we should just do

118
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,480
less things

119
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,840
nothing wrong with that advice i just

120
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,400
don't think it's enough by itself to

121
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,040
actually cure what ails us

122
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,319
because we do like to do things

123
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,599
there's nothing that makes us more

124
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,600
consistently miserable as a species

125
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,600
than actually doing nothing for any

126
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,959
extended period of time it makes us very

127
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,720
uncomfortable it makes us feel

128
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,360
non-efficacious it makes us feel

129
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,280
rootless and bored and anxious we'd like

130
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,520
to do things the problem is not activity

131
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,960
the problem is too much activity so

132
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,919
we need a

133
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,759
more

134
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,880
sophisticated solution than simply

135
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,720
saying

136
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,320
it's okay to not do as many things just

137
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,000
do less

138
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,520
that maybe is a

139
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,919
step in the right direction but we need

140
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,919
to take many steps more this is what

141
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,960
brings me to my recent thinking on this

142
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,120
emerging concept of slow productivity

143
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,639
slow productivity is meant as a response

144
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,120
to this question of what should we do in

145
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,759
the face of being exhausted

146
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,120
by all that we have to do

147
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,120
so to look into this topic of slow

148
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,520
productivity i started by trying to

149
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,800
understand

150
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,199
what was productivity for our ancient

151
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,759
ancestors

152
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,759
in other words as human beings

153
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,520
what is natural

154
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,120
when it comes to activity

155
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,400
there's a basic question but we need an

156
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,520
answer to this question of what is

157
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,199
natural if we're going to try to get

158
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,960
back to something that's more

159
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,800
attuned to the human condition and so i

160
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,919
went back and did some work trying to

161
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,320
understand the rhythms of activity of

162
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,600
our paleolithic ancestors

163
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,759
we obviously don't have direct

164
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,919
observations about this but i ended up

165
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,479
talking to a quantitative anthropologist

166
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,320
from oxford university who is one of the

167
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,680
world's experts at studying extant

168
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,520
hunter-gatherer tribes in the

169
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,919
philippines and using robust methods to

170
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,479
try to try to measure

171
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,840
what their activity levels are like and

172
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,919
very carefully try to make some

173
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,440
extrapolations from this to other to our

174
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,880
hunter-gatherer past that's an

175
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,800
extrapolation you have to do carefully

176
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,880
but he's sensitive and careful about

177
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,800
that and here's basically what you see

178
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,039
our best guess

179
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,280
at what activity was like

180
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:09,280
for the bulk of our species existence is

181
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,240
you would be doing skilled and important

182
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,400
work

183
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,880
basically every day

184
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,000
mainly focused on food acquisition and

185
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,960
preparation as well as child rearing

186
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,039
but you would be uh you know these

187
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,639
extant tribes they studied if you were

188
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,560
gathering herbs

189
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,319
you had a huge expert understanding of

190
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,840
the various plants and their various

191
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,280
uses it's very expert work or if you're

192
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,720
hunting hunting was a very skilled

193
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,400
activity when you don't have very

194
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,919
sophisticated

195
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,479
weapons like rifles right so you're

196
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,039
doing skilled but important work

197
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,800
at a natural pace

198
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,319
this is definitely what they found in

199
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,000
their work on these tribes is there's

200
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,639
lots of breaks

201
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,240
you might be spending all day on a hunt

202
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,199
but there's going to be a two-hour part

203
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,120
in the middle of the day where you're

204
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,199
just resting and maybe you take there's

205
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,280
a nap over here there's a natural pace

206
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,680
with ups and downs of intensity and

207
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,680
never too many things at the same time

208
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,199
there's no notion of i have 18 things

209
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,560
i'm trying to get done

210
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,840
as a paleolithic hunter-gatherer and i'm

211
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,840
trying to go through this list it's like

212
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,599
we're doing this today and then that

213
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,479
right that's basically what we did

214
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:17,840
throughout most of our history

215
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,360
now compare that to where we are today

216
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,039
where we are today and let's focus

217
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,240
mainly on the world of work just to keep

218
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,800
this

219
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,319
more precise where we are today

220
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,560
is

221
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,880
maintaining lists of things that we need

222
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,800
to do obligations and commitment some of

223
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,599
them explicit some of them implicit that

224
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,840
are

225
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,919
massive

226
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,599
massive list of obligations and

227
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,680
commitments in the world of work these

228
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,680
just come flying at us through emails

229
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,680
they come flying at us through quick

230
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,879
requests during zoom meetings hey cal

231
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,000
can you take care of this or can you

232
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,680
jump on this flying at us in informal

233
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,080
conversations in the hallway where a

234
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,759
boss grabs you and says

235
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,800
look into this can you get this done for

236
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,360
me and we have these very large list of

237
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,199
things that are on our plate i call this

238
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,639
state chronic overload because we have

239
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,160
more things on our plate than we can

240
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,599
easily imagine how we're going to get

241
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,000
them done and this is a state that is

242
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,919
persistent we constantly have this

243
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,280
overloaded list of things that we have

244
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,120
to do

245
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,319
this causes three problems three

246
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,960
problems that we're not faced by our

247
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,280
paleolithic ancestors one is just the

248
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,039
simple short circuiting of the center of

249
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,520
our brain that is dedicated to making

250
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,280
long-term plans

251
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,879
goal completion

252
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,960
humans have a center in their brain that

253
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,560
does this very well even our close

254
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,800
primate relatives do not have anything

255
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,719
that's quite as powerful as our ability

256
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,200
to plan and go after goals this is

257
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,039
tapped into our motivational systems

258
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,120
we feel good when we make a plan we feel

259
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,440
even better when we execute the plan we

260
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,680
feel bad if we don't

261
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,640
this system gets completely overloaded

262
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,920
when you have 700 unread messages in

263
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,519
your inbox and 75 different projects

264
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,519
tasks and ongoing commitments that

265
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,440
you're trying to juggle it is too many

266
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,760
things for that part of your brain to

267
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,440
imagine how it's going to accomplish and

268
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,959
it short circuits that planning that

269
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,760
planning center of our brain that makes

270
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,440
us anxious that makes us miserable

271
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,519
again our paleolithic ancestors never

272
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,680
had 700 unread emails each of which

273
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,200
representing a commitment

274
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,480
that we can't wrap our mind around how

275
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,800
we ever gonna satisfy all these

276
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,080
commitments two

277
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,200
when you have way more things on your

278
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,279
plate than you can easily imagine

279
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,720
handling you suffer from what i think is

280
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,200
one of the more

281
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,240
insidious tortures of modern office work

282
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,720
which is the

283
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,399
overhead spiral

284
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,760
so if you give me something to do here's

285
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,920
a project

286
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,360
i want you to work with these two people

287
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,800
and get it done

288
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,200
there is a fixed amount of overhead

289
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,560
that comes with this project because we

290
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,880
have to kind of coordinate so there's

291
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,640
going to be i don't know some notion of

292
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,320
number of meetings we have to do to talk

293
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,240
things through and make a plan there'll

294
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,000
be some non-trivial number of emails we

295
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,360
have to send back and forth to get

296
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,040
questions answered or to move the

297
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,959
project forward

298
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,399
in isolation that's all fine if i'm

299
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,680
working on something yeah let's meet

300
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,279
about it once a week and send some

301
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,200
emails in between that's fine that's

302
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,560
just the overhead cost of working with

303
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,440
people to accomplish something no

304
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,839
problem the issue is what if we have 25

305
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,000
of these ongoing at the same time each

306
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,760
of them has the same fixed amount of

307
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,440
overhead each one needs that weekly

308
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,839
meeting each one needs a couple dozen

309
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,640
emails sent each week and it adds and

310
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,959
adds and ads until your schedule becomes

311
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,440
overloaded

312
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,200
with this fixed overhead

313
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,240
and now you are spending almost all of

314
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,640
your time

315
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,440
talking about the work you need to do

316
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,279
with no time left to actually execute

317
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,120
the work

318
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,800
again i think this is the knowledge

319
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,800
worker equivalent of chinese water

320
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:47,920
torture it is maddening it is deranging

321
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,519
we saw this really clearly amplified

322
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,959
during the first half year of the

323
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,920
chronovirus pandemic where office

324
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,839
workers had to suddenly work remote

325
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,519
shifting operations remote meant that

326
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,720
there was a lot of new work that got

327
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,880
generated right because we have to

328
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,120
figure out how do we do our work if

329
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,519
we're remote so suddenly everyone's

330
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,959
obligation list got bigger each of these

331
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,959
things brought with it a meeting and

332
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,880
some emails what happened

333
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,279
i heard report after report from

334
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:17,519
knowledge workers saying i am spending

335
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:19,440
eight straight hours per day in zoom

336
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,560
i would get complaints from people that

337
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,399
said my biggest issue is i don't know

338
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,279
when to use the bathroom during the day

339
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:30,640
i'm on zoom that often in zoom doing

340
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:33,440
email while in zoomed the entire day

341
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,720
this is a parody of work life where all

342
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,240
you're doing is talking about work not

343
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,240
just i have too many meetings all you

344
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,360
were doing was meetings that's overhead

345
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,360
spiral

346
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,640
personified right there so again you

347
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,399
have too many things on your plate that

348
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,000
you've committed to the overhead itself

349
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,839
takes over your whole schedule and

350
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,720
finally the last issue with chronic

351
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,800
overload is we it's relentless in its

352
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,959
pace there is never any time where you

353
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,800
get to relax there's never any time you

354
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,639
get to downshift

355
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,880
remember our paleolithic ancestors if

356
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,240
they're doing an all-day hunt

357
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,320
might have hours in there where they're

358
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,360
just sitting around yeah it's the heat

359
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,120
of the day

360
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,959
let's sit in the shade of a tree and

361
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,800
just like nap and chat

362
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,160
or we hunted the last two days it's kind

363
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,639
of rainy today not great conditions

364
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,440
we're not going to hunt today at all

365
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,040
in a system of modern work with chronic

366
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,079
overload where you always have way more

367
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,839
on your plate than you ever can get

368
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:25,600
around the handling there is a constant

369
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,800
pressure on execution because there's

370
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,639
always things that need to get it done

371
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,000
and you're always behind

372
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,320
so every day

373
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,760
you fill it relentless work every minute

374
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,040
you have available

375
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,320
probably have to do some evenings

376
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,120
probably have to do some weekends as

377
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,440
well to get around the overhead spirals

378
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,760
we're not wired for this relentless pace

379
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,519
of work where you never have any relief

380
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,240
and it's pegged at

381
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,000
this 10 on the scale of 1 to 10 of how

382
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,399
much how hard you're working day after

383
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,560
day after day after day

384
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,760
this i think is the more

385
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,880
detailed

386
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,480
socio-physiological explanation for what

387
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,320
all of those anti-productivity books

388
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,639
were commenting on this is why we're so

389
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,320
miserable chronic overload creates those

390
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,040
three problems those three problems

391
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,639
alienate us from the the rhythms of work

392
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,800
for which we're wired as people and that

393
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,120
is why we're not happy

394
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,519
that is then what we need to solve

395
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,200
how do we get rid of chronic overload

396
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,320
how do we get rid of those

397
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,680
issues that come from chronic overload

398
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,360
just saying i'm going to do less isn't

399
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,959
going to cut it

400
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,880
hey boss

401
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,639
i've decided i don't want to be a part

402
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,639
of the exploitative capitalist engine

403
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,880
so i'm not going to work today

404
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,440
good luck not going to solve it we need

405
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,040
we need a more detailed sophisticated uh

406
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,040
solution here it's not going to work to

407
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,880
say hey client

408
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,399
i do not want to be a

409
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,000
stooge in a a protestant work ethic

410
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,040
culture established during the

411
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,760
pre-colonial period uh in the early days

412
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,760
of migration to the united states so um

413
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,920
i'm not going to answer your email

414
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,519
that's not a solution we need something

415
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,680
more sophisticated all right slow

416
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,320
productivity is that answer

417
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,079
slow productivity is that answer

418
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,000
let me give you three quick ideas for

419
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,600
what slow productivity might mean three

420
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,120
elements to it this is going to evolve

421
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,800
but let's try to get something pinned

422
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,560
down here so to me there's three big

423
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,120
things i care about with a slow

424
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,440
productivity philosophy

425
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,040
doing fewer things

426
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,720
doing those things at a natural pace

427
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,040
obsessing over the quality of the things

428
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,040
you do

429
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,440
that definition of productivity a

430
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,079
productivity that prioritizes those

431
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,600
three things i think can get us back

432
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,839
towards

433
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,839
the rhythms of work for which we are

434
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,839
wired while also

435
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,720
fulfilling us doing interesting work

436
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,920
letting our companies grow

437
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,240
helping our

438
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,600
team succeed getting promotion still

439
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,639
getting the autonomy that comes from

440
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,040
getting good at things that are rare and

441
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,160
valuable that is compatible with that

442
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,320
so let me just touch on those three

443
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,000
things real quickly

444
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,079
do fewer things

445
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,240
i think your workload and ideal world

446
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,440
would be below that level of chronic

447
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,040
overload

448
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,320
you have few enough things that you are

449
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,839
committed to doing on your plate that

450
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,120
you are not suffering from the short

451
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,480
circuiting of your planning circuit

452
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,800
you're not suffering from overhead

453
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,760
spirals and you do not feel like you

454
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,480
have no

455
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,000
no

456
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,680
option but to have a relentless pace for

457
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,680
your feeling every minute of your day we

458
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,120
need to do many fewer things

459
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,440
and if you work for yourself if you're a

460
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,440
freelancer run your own company

461
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,759
aggressively titrate how many things you

462
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,440
take on at the same time

463
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,120
you are not a computer processor where

464
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,560
you want your

465
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,320
pipeline of

466
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,000
instructions to execute to be full so

467
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,519
you never miss a particular tick you're

468
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,120
a human

469
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,040
you're not wired to do that we need to

470
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,720
do many fewer things what if you work

471
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,320
for someone else

472
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,720
well i think we need to completely

473
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,839
rethink how work is assigned in the

474
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,279
workplace this should be transparent

475
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,880
how much work is this person doing

476
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,040
what's on their plate

477
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,199
so we can all see it and then we can

478
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,880
have very clear understandings of what

479
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,440
is reasonable

480
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,680
and if i see you know jesse has

481
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,600
a fair number of things on his plate i

482
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,120
can't put something else on it it's on

483
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,480
me to figure out something pops up it

484
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,560
needs to get done at some point i can't

485
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,160
just say jesse handle this i have to

486
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,000
figure out

487
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,000
where does this go

488
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,839
until someone has room for it it can't

489
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,600
just go on their plate the answer here

490
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:25,040
is probably going to be external systems

491
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,720
things that need to get done go into

492
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,000
external systems where they bring with

493
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,759
them the information they need to be

494
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,320
accomplished and have clear statuses and

495
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,639
priorities and then individuals pull

496
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,639
pull work out of the system as new slots

497
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,320
open

498
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,920
this might sound like it's a pain i

499
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,320
don't care if it's a pain

500
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,000
it's what we're wired to do keep my load

501
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,519
reasonable

502
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,880
and i'll pull in new stuff when i'm done

503
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,079
with what's on my plate don't just give

504
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,120
it all to me and say figure it out

505
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,720
you're going to short circuit my brain

506
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,759
you're going to make me miserable

507
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,160
all right second piece of slow

508
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:58,959
productivity work at a natural pace

509
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,360
we cannot just peg our efforts at a 10

510
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,120
for eight to nine hours a day

511
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,559
day after day week after week week after

512
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,039
week

513
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:10,400
this is not natural for humans we need

514
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,640
seasonality in our work first of all

515
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,160
seasonality meaning hard times balanced

516
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,120
by easier times and i think we should

517
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,839
have this

518
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,679
at all

519
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,120
scales so this week some days are harder

520
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,199
than others

521
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,640
i'm going to pull back on friday and

522
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,679
come into the weekend maybe a little bit

523
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,880
more relaxed but monday i'm pegging it

524
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,880
we should have

525
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,360
certain months

526
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,320
perhaps that are more intense than

527
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,840
others

528
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,200
this is an intense month we're kind of

529
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,440
getting after it but you know what in

530
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,799
june things really get quiet around here

531
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,960
and i'm pulling back and i'm going to

532
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,640
have very light days right so uh

533
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,760
seasonality at different levels maybe

534
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,520
even seasons like professors do

535
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,960
winter i'm getting after it summer i'm

536
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,200
pulled back far

537
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,400
rest recovery up down up down at all

538
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,919
scales

539
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,600
i think we absolutely need this the

540
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,000
other thing we have to do to get a more

541
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,520
natural pace to our work is adjust the

542
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,360
time scale at which we care about

543
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,880
accomplishment

544
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,640
instead of caring about how much do i

545
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,559
get done on the scale of days and weeks

546
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,039
you say i worry about what i get done on

547
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,799
the scale of months and years

548
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,919
completely changes your relationship to

549
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,840
the current moment when you want to

550
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,960
produce a good number of very high

551
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,480
quality things over the next three years

552
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,320
it really changes how you feel about

553
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,840
tuesday

554
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,520
now it's not so important that every

555
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,799
minute of tuesday you're getting after

556
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,160
it in fact you might say i need to take

557
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,320
a couple weeks off here so that i can

558
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,919
really have a high quality push for the

559
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,520
weeks that follow it completely changes

560
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,679
your relationship to work when you say i

561
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,360
don't care about how many things i check

562
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,679
off a list this week what i care about

563
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,360
is what is on my cv that i produce over

564
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,880
the last five years

565
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,120
that's much more compatible with

566
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,559
seasonality ups and downs the final

567
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,080
point here the final part of slow

568
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,760
productivity i mentioned was obsessed

569
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,840
about quality

570
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,360
if you're going to do less

571
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,760
you need to pair that with doing what

572
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,280
you do better

573
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,880
this will make the work more fulfilling

574
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,400
because you're building and applying

575
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,640
craft

576
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,679
remember our example of our paleolithic

577
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,760
ancestors skilled important activity

578
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,320
we get motivation for that

579
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,280
we don't get motivation for adjusting

580
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:18,320
the fonts in a powerpoint deck

581
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,520
for fundraising for some company idea we

582
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,679
probably shouldn't be doing in the first

583
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,559
place just because we're bored

584
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,400
but

585
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,840
crafting the computer program that's

586
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,840
going to run and do something really

587
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,600
cool and you can see it producing the

588
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,640
book the brilliant new marketing

589
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,640
campaign

590
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,760
so we want to focus on doing smaller

591
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,120
number things but doing those things

592
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,520
much better is going to feel more

593
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,520
fulfilling it is also what is going to

594
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,960
give you both the ability and the

595
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,280
courage to say no to other things

596
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,840
when your main metric becomes how do i

597
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,280
do what i do better

598
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,640
now it's easy to say i'm not going to do

599
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,480
this mid lean thing

600
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,559
i'm not going to do this distraction

601
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,160
i'm not going to jump on this call i'm

602
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,160
not going to learn this new plugin that

603
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,919
maybe will bring me some new email

604
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,200
subscribers for my news list because

605
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,720
that's not going to help me get better

606
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,799
at what i'm trying to do

607
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,400
it is much much easier to be minimalist

608
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,320
in your scheduling when you're focused

609
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,400
relentlessly on a small number of things

610
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,400
getting better and better at it it also

611
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,000
earns you the right to be more

612
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,039
autonomous

613
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,440
the better you get at what you do best

614
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,000
the more leeway you have to say i'm not

615
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,120
coming onto that committee i am not

616
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,480
going to

617
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,840
do this client contract it's barely

618
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,480
overlaps what i like to do it's going to

619
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,640
be

620
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,799
incredibly time consuming

621
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,360
i'm not going to have to do 25 social

622
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,600
media posts a day in some quixotic quest

623
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,480
to build up an influencer audience it

624
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,159
gives you the autonomy you need

625
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,720
to take control over what you spend your

626
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,880
time on and what you don't

627
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,360
so that is my answer that is my answer

628
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,559
to the anti-productivity movement yes we

629
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,480
are overloaded it's a problem why

630
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,919
because of chronic overload causes all

631
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,480
these issues that alienates us from our

632
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:01,600
human wiring what's the solution

633
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:04,559
not to discard productivity

634
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,400
and say do less and let's celebrate that

635
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,840
but to get more specific and say let's

636
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,240
redefine productivity

637
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,760
we'll call it slow productivity

638
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,360
and we're going to build this very

639
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,640
intentionally from the ground up to get

640
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,720
our work lives back aligned with our

641
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,559
ancient wiring

642
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,720
do fewer things

643
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,880
do this work at a natural pace

644
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,039
obsess over quality

645
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,640
that i believe is the proper response to

646
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,200
our current

647
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,799
rightly pointed out as problematic state

648
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,280
of overload

649
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,600
that is how we take back control of

650
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,200
activity in our life and keep it

651
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,440
fulfilling keep it meaningful keep

652
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,600
options open but also

653
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,280
get away from all of the issues we're

654
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,760
currently facing in our world of chronic

655
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,760
overload

656
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,600
all right so that's what i have on slow

657
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,240
productivity that's a new thought guys

658
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,039
so i'm sure it's going to evolve

659
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,240
uh

660
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,799
jesse you've heard me talk about this a

661
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,240
few times now did you just you've heard

662
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,240
i just listened to you talk about on the

663
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,720
ferris interview yesterday

664
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,400
that's right yeah so the day before

665
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,240
the day before this came out or a couple

666
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,159
days before my interview with the tim

667
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,159
ferriss came out and slow productivity

668
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,360
was one of the topics that we got into

669
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,720
i've also written about slow

670
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,720
productivity in for the new yorker so my

671
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,159
my last of my office based columns for

672
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,640
them which came out in early january was

673
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,880
on slow productivity uh and i may or may

674
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,080
not be working on a book proposal

675
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,520
on the topic so you might be wondering

676
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,960
why i'm talking about it

677
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,039
uh

678
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,440
i mean ironically for a book on slow

679
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,280
productivity it can't come out fast

680
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,799
i think that's the problem i was like

681
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:45,039
guys i stayed up every night for two

682
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,120
months and got this book done by just

683
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:50,240
relentlessly working as fast as possible

684
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,240
i think that's not gonna work

685
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,360
yeah you talked about this in the past

686
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,400
too in previous podcast episodes where

687
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,360
you said you were going to kind of walk

688
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,039
us through

689
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,640
the process of writing the book and

690
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,760
stuff so i'm looking forward to that

691
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,760
it's actually

692
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,919
already started yeah so maybe there's

693
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,640
some breaking news here so in in past

694
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:11,039
podcast episodes we were talking about

695
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,640
a book i'm working on a proposal on for

696
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,640
the deep life

697
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,960
this would be a second book

698
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,880
so i might be i'm working on potentially

699
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,640
the deep life and slow productivity in

700
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,840
some order

701
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,919
might be the next two books all right

702
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,840
none of that is inked you know none of

703
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,320
that's actually written down or signed

704
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,360
or none of it's official uh but that's

705
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,559
that's what i'm currently thinking is

706
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,400
those might be the next two books i

707
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,600
write and that's what you did before the

708
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,240
last two books right you worked on them

709
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,679
simultaneously yeah i like doing that um

710
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,600
because i want to just work i want to

711
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,679
think deeply and write

712
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,360
and so i sold

713
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,120
digital minimalism in a world without

714
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,640
email i sold those at the same time and

715
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,400
then that allowed me to just not worry

716
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,400
about selling books for four or five

717
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,480
years i could just write when i was done

718
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,320
with one book i knew what i was working

719
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,559
on i mean i'm gonna put my head down and

720
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,919
right type of guy that makes me happy

721
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,400
having to go out and talk about the

722
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,400
books you know okay that's harder for me

723
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,360
i like the part where it's just me

724
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,440
me and the idea i guess me and the idea

725
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,279
and jesse and tens of thousands of

726
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,039
podcast listeners but but that's it just

727
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,919
our small circle talking about these

728
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,960
things

729
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,400
um

730
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,679
so i like that i like to sell multiple

731
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,600
books at a time if i can because i don't

732
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,360
want to spend it's a pain to sell books

733
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,760
man and it's it's

734
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,919
it's stressful and it's complicated and

735
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,919
there's a ton of

736
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,679
fiddling overhead on it too i mean these

737
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,159
proposals are

738
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,080
50 pages long it just takes a long time

739
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,559
to write but it's not fun writing it's

740
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,919
not oh i'm writing about ideas it's you

741
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,000
know you're writing about your marketing

742
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,919
plan and stuff like that so yeah

743
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,200
i try not to do it more than i need to

744
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,120
one thing you mentioned the ferris

745
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,360
interview was he asked you started off

746
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,960
with your relationship or your

747
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,000
steve martin he was asking about him and

748
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,840
