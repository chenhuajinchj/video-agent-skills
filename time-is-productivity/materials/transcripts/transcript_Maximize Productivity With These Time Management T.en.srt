1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,560
are you a list maker like do you wake up

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,240
in the morning and make lists and cross

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,200
things off and then decide what are the

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,960
key items on that list no I'm a Time

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,759
blocker time blocker yeah yeah so I'm

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,200
not a big believer in to-do list I like

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,680
to Grapple with the actual available

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,000
time like okay I have a meeting here I

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,680
have to like pick my kids up from school

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,519
here here's the actual hours of the day

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,519
that are free and where they fall all

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,800
right what do I want to do at that time

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,080
well okay now that I see that there's a

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,679
lot of gaps in the middle of the day

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,480
here they're short maybe there I'm going

16
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,079
to do lot of small non-c conly demanding

17
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,760
thing oh this first 90 minutes in the

18
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:36,280
morning is like the main time I have

19
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,000
uninterrupted okay so this I'm going to

20
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,039
work on writing so i' I've been a big

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,480
believer of this since I was an

22
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:45,000
undergrad like you give your time a job

23
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,320
as opposed to having a list which is

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,800
somewhat orthogonal to what's actually

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,840
happening in your day and then just as

26
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,120
you go through your day saying what do I

27
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,239
want to try to do next which I think is

28
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,079
a lot less

29
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,840
efficient I'm going to try your method

30
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,239
um I try and structure my days as much

31
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,199
as I can but it just never quite Works

32
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:05,720
um do work late into the night or you no

33
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:07,680
no I'm I'm a 5:30 man okay yeah so 5:30

34
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,040
p.m. that's it yeah more or less that's

35
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,240
my cut off now the the one exception is

36
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,479
um if I'm writing on Deadline I'll

37
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,759
sometimes like if I need to get more

38
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,520
writing done I can do uh an evening

39
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:20,079
writing session which which I got used

40
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,960
to through long experience of I used to

41
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,240
write my blog post at night after like

42
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,560
my kids went to bed now they're older

43
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,600
and they don't go to bed as early so

44
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,320
it's like the one thing I have left that

45
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,520
I'll do after 5:30 is like every once in

46
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,720
a while I'll do like a 90 minute evening

47
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,320
writing block um but I call this by the

48
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,680
way this whole philosophy I call fix

49
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,759
schedule productivity and I've been

50
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,079
doing it since I was a grad student fix

51
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,520
the work hour schedule that's my

52
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,640
commitment I work in these hours um and

53
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,520
then work Downstream from that for

54
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,439
everything else so like this controls

55
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,759
like even what you decide to bring into

56
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,079
your life because you know I can't go

57
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:52,360
past a schedule um and it drives you to

58
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,880
be more Innovative and how you deal with

59
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,200
your time and schedule you have to be

60
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,840
efficient because you only have these

61
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,799
these hours here uh that's been you know

62
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,320
a signal for my my since I was in my

63
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,960
early 20s fix the schedule and don't

64
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,560
work outside of that schedule now it's

65
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,799
your move to figure out anything you

66
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,800
want to do you have to make that work

67
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,119
you want to become a professor figure

68
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,039
out how to make that work you want to

69
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:12,400
write books while you're being a

70
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,720
professor figure out how to make that

71
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,599
work you don't have the option of just

72
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,920
throwing hours at it and you innovate a

73
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,319
lot I think when you have the

74
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,120
constraints where do sleep and exercise

75
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,959
fit into your schedule uh what's your

76
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,840
typical to bed time wakeup time what's

77
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,120
your um typical exercise routine and the

78
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,000
reason I ask about this is because I

79
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,000
think nowadays we hopefully people

80
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,599
understand that exercise and cognitive

81
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,800
function are are inextricably linked

82
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:42,040
yeah and we're all going to live longer

83
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,480
lives and be sharper mentally by doing

84
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,120
exercise yeah so I mean my main like

85
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,680
actual working with weights I do this

86
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,280
predinner right and this was an

87
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,200
innovation the last couple of years it's

88
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,959
it's a fantastic psychologically for me

89
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,200
this is a transition from work to like

90
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,480
family time after work so so I'll do

91
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,440
like 45 50 minutes uh garage God's gym

92
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,560
you know that we built during Co after

93
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,400
I'm done working before dinner and once

94
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,640
you get used to that like it also forces

95
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,319
you to like I got to finish work because

96
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,879
I got to get this in before dinner but

97
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:12,480
then I'll do also quite a bit of walking

98
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,200
if it's not a teaching day so I'm not on

99
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,680
campus uh I do a lot of thinking on foot

100
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,080
um you know walking my kids to the bus

101
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,480
stop which isn't particularly close in

102
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,480
back so I'll do a lot of walking but

103
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,000
that's when I my serious exercise now is

104
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,360
always always pre- dinner then uh I want

105
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,400
to be up you know in our room by 10:

106
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,760
yeah and then at that point I don't

107
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,720
track so I have insomnia issues which

108
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,120
which actually has been like key driver

109
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,599
of a lot of the things I think about

110
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,239
especially with slow productivity is I'm

111
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:43,560
very wary because I can without any

112
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,439
control on my own just find myself

113
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,640
unable to sleep sometimes fall asleep or

114
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,920
stay asleep fall asleep yeah I mean I

115
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,079
used to get it really bad um not so bad

116
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,599
now but you know it comes and goes that

117
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,720
really affected the way I thought about

118
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,360
productivity because it seemed like to

119
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,400
me the the definition of just I get

120
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,079
after it with a bunch of stuff

121
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,840
wasn't really on the table because if my

122
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:06,360
notion of productivity depended on me

123
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,560
like every day being able to just like

124
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,239
hammer on a bunch of stuff I'm very busy

125
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,280
I have lots of commitments what would

126
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,239
happen if I couldn't sleep I wouldn't be

127
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,760
able to do that so it I drifted

128
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,199
naturally towards a definition of

129
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,560
productivity which was it doesn't really

130
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,040
matter if you work tomorrow but it is

131
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,520
important that like this month you work

132
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,400
like writing a book it doesn't matter if

133
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,960
you work on your book chapter tomorrow

134
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,199
in particular but like this month you

135
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,560
have to spend a lot of time working on

136
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,400
it so it was uh like an insomnia

137
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,720
compatible definition of productivity

138
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,520
was sort of morphed into this idea of

139
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,000
slow productivity taking your your time

140
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,720
with it so it's interesting so like

141
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,240
sleep issues really shaped the way I

142
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,199
thought about work and put me on these

143
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,759
much longer time scales of productivity

144
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,199
try not to be dependent on any

145
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,560
particular day being critical to what

146
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,360
you do I don't want the high stress

147
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,400
situation I don't want the like I'm just

148
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,000
going to 10 hours a day for the next 10

149
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,160
days we're going to make this deal

150
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,759
happen like I can't operate in that

151
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,720
space because I worry about it anytime

152
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,800
my brain could betray me and I could

153
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,080
like lose sleep for a couple days I

154
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,880
think it's really important that you're

155
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,520
sharing this because while people's

156
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,360
challenges differ I think often times

157
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,120
people hear the content of my podcast or

158
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,039
other podcasts and think oh gosh I have

159
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,080
to have everything dialed in just right

160
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:18,160
when in fact most all of the tools and

161
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,240
protocols that have been discussed on

162
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,479
the huberman Lab podcast are in response

163
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,919
to a particular challenge that I've had

164
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:28,800
um or that others close to me have had

165
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,800
um and I I love this well I I'm sorry

166
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,800
that you suffer from insomnia U we have

167
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,919
a series uh on sleep with Matt Walker in

168
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,080
which he lays out some some great tools

169
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,919
that we haven't yet discussed on the

170
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,520
podcast I'll just um send you I'll text

171
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:43,520
you I'll call you with with a short list

172
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,319
of those and hopefully they'll help but

173
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,560
as we do cover insomnia in some depth

174
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:48,840
but but I think it's important that

175
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,800
people realize that they can be very

176
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,319
productive with the hours that they have

177
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,720
and the the moments or hours of of high

178
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,919
focus Clarity that they have um even if

179
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,440
they're not sleeping great even if

180
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:03,680
they're raising small children um

181
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,960
because that's the real world and

182
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,440
certainly that's the real world of

183
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:12,440
deadlines and Academia but um family and

184
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,440
um colds and flu and travel and jet lag

185
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:18,120
and arguments and all the happy stuff

186
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,440
too Vacations so um sounds like you're

187
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,120
very good at adapting your day to what's

188
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,160
going on around it but that you have

189
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,840
certain sort of committed time um am I

190
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,280
correct in assuming that you have at

191
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,240
least one period of say

192
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,479
60 to 90 minutes of real what you would

193
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,000
call Deep work uh let's say at least 5

194
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:39,319
days a week I know that might be an

195
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,080
underestimate but seems like that's what

196
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:43,440
what I'm that's what I'm extracting from

197
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,319
this that's the goal right so so to me

198
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,120
uh depending on the season is how

199
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:48,919
extreme that I can get so the the

200
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,400
busiest season would be like a teaching

201
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:52,680
semester right but even then I'm going

202
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,000
to make sure that five days a week I'm

203
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,879
starting with deep work and the

204
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,680
non-teaching days are more than the

205
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:59,840
teaching days compare that to the summer

206
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,479
for example where like all I do for the

207
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,639
most part is deep work no meetings on

208
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:06,599
Mondays and Fridays all admin stuff is

209
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,639
uh midday to early afternoon Tuesday

210
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:10,840
Wednesday Thursday um everything else is

211
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,919
deep work you know just locked in you

212
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,919
hours at a time but I want if I'm not

213
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:19,080
getting five days five days of starting

214
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,599
the day with deep work I'm I'm unhappy

215
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,639
right because I mean I keep coming back

216
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:24,000
to this is okay because I'm not going to

217
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,360
be able to I mean fortunately the

218
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,400
insomnia doesn't bother hasn't bothered

219
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,000
me in years but the the the threat of it

220
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,199
like completely shaped the way I I think

221
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,800
about things and because I know I'm

222
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,800
never going to be uh have a sort of like

223
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,440
an Elon mus style energy of like I can

224
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,800
just take on seven companies and make it

225
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,160
happen right I just don't have that

226
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,879
ability um I've always focused on the

227
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,720
long game and to me the long game plays

228
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:47,319
out with get your deep work time in you

229
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,440
know just keep working on the stuff you

230
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,039
do best and get better at it you know

231
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,520
tomorrow doesn't matter but if you if

232
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,039
you're doing this most days for the next

233
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,560
four months like that's going to matter

234
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:57,360
you know and so I often think about

235
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,000
productivity in my own life at the scale

236
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,120
of decades what do I want to do in my 20

237
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,560
you know okay what do I want to do in my

238
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,960
30s you know what do I want to do in my

239
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,440
40s you know U and that helps like in my

240
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,240
30s I had a lot of young kids like it's

241
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,440
yeah I mean the amount of time I could

242
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,639
spend total working is like much less

243
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,919
right but I could still think about what

244
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,319
do I want to do in my 30s how do I make

245
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:18,919
that happen let me make sure I'm pushing

246
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:20,759
like on those things then everything

247
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:22,199
else I can adapt to I can give here and

248
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,680
there you know it allows you to be very

249
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,159
adaptable when you're thinking about

250
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,440
what do I want to do you know for the

251
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:30,560
next 10 years it also means you're not

252
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,800
on a random Tuesday try yourself because

253
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,399
like why didn't I get three more hours

254
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,320
of working that becomes sort of a

255
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:36,680
nonsensical question when what you care

256
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,479
about is like what happens in the next

257
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,719
decade which is that's the long game

258
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,000
it's not about you know hustling today

259
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:45,839
it's about I came back to deep Ork day

260
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,399
after day after day when other people

261
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,880
got distracted by Tik Tok you know like

262
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,959
I'm GNA you whatever it's that coming

263
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,399
