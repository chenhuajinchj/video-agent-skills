00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,549
I recently read the book deep work by

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:08,280
author Cal Newport Cal defines deep work

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:10,349
as professional activities performed in

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,840
a state of distraction free

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,700
concentration that pushes your cognitive

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,250
abilities to their limit these efforts

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:21,029
create new value improve your skill and

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,039
are hard to replicate JK rowling use

9
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,019
deep work to complete the final book of

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,900
her Harry Potter series the deadly

11
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,849
hollows in 2007 she needed to escape the

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,219
distraction of screaming kids and

13
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,170
barking dogs so she checked into a suite

14
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:37,350
in a five-star hotel in downtown

15
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,360
Edinburgh Scotland she says I didn't

16
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,460
intend to stay there but the first days

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,340
writing went well so I kept coming back

18
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,829
and I ended up finishing the last of the

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,309
Harry Potter books here Bill Gates used

20
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:53,489
deep work in 1974 to program the first

21
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,140
version of basic in just eight weeks Cal

22
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,420
says that Gates worked with such

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,190
intensity for such lengths during the

24
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,949
two-month stretch that he would often

25
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,530
collapse into sleep on his keyboard in

26
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:06,780
the middle of writing a line of code he

27
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,210
would then sleep for an hour to wake up

28
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,310
and pick up right where he left off the

29
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,990
basic software that Gates wrote in eight

30
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,270
weeks well in a state of deep work

31
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,180
became the foundation of a billion

32
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,850
dollar company author Cal Newport an MIT

33
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,040
graduate and Georgetown professor claims

34
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,439
that deep work allowed him to double his

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,420
output of research papers while raising

36
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,390
a family writing this book and teaching

37
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,000
full-time at a prestigious university

38
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,740
the first two cases Gates and JK Rowling

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,570
might be extreme as most people don't

40
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,060
have the ability to go off the grid and

41
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,829
do deep work for weeks at a time but Cal

42
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,200
shows that we can maintain a busy

43
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,570
schedule and still find ways to do deep

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,220
work and produce significant results in

45
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,490
our lives that others find hard to

46
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,990
replicate but how exactly does deep work

47
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,149
lead to these best-selling books

48
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,310
innovative products and elite levels of

49
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,290
productivity while neuroscientists have

50
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,590
found that intense periods of focus in

51
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,920
isolated fields of work causes myelin to

52
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,810
develop in relevant areas of the brain

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,360
myelin is a white tissue that develops

54
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,270
around neurons and allows brain cells to

55
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,900
fire faster and cleaner so in a sense

56
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,849
when we practice deep

57
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,250
work we upgrade our brains and allow

58
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:21,220
specific brain circuits to fire more

59
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,500
effortlessly and effectively the brain

60
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,810
upgrade we get from deep work allows you

61
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,420
to rapidly connect ideas and uncover

62
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,310
creative solutions in today's economy

63
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,530
the ability to do deep work is

64
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,750
increasingly valuable an increasingly

65
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,340
rare it's valuable because when you

66
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,439
produce something great in our

67
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,290
hyper-connected world it has the ability

68
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:42,370
to spread to billions of people

69
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,769
producing something great is necessary

70
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,090
to stand out amongst the noise and avoid

71
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:47,769
being forgotten by the flood of

72
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,870
information that we deal with on a

73
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:52,450
day-to-day basis think of your last

74
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,489
tweet how long did it last how quickly

75
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,200
was it forgotten

76
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:59,139
deep work is becoming increasingly rare

77
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,269
because deep work requires undivided

78
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:03,189
attention and our world is being filled

79
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:05,409
with more and more tempting distractions

80
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:06,959
so the ability to do deep work is

81
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:08,799
becoming increasingly difficult

82
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,750
co-workers expect you to immediately

83
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:12,939
respond to an email or an instant

84
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,159
message employers want you to function

85
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:17,409
in an open office concept of constant

86
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:19,449
distraction your friends and followers

87
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:21,970
online expect you to maintain a social

88
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:23,859
media presence it's not enough to try to

89
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,750
ignore these distractions we are

90
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:29,349
hard-wired to be distracted and pay

91
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:32,049
attention to novelty in a 2012 study led

92
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:35,230
by psychologists Wilhelm Hofmann and Roy

93
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:37,000
Baumeister involving 205 adults found

94
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,340
that we are only able to resist

95
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,379
temptations to take a break from work to

96
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,650
check email surf the web or watch TV

97
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:46,659
just fifty percent of the time but there

98
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,000
is hope you can build a scale of deep

99
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:51,579
work and escape the trap of constant

100
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,650
distraction thus separating you from the

101
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:56,500
pack and making you indispensable in

102
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,239
today's economy here are three deep work

103
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,340
strategies that you can incorporate into

104
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,109
your schedule to heighten your ability

105
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,470
to focus and produce results that are

106
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:07,599
hard to replicate first schedule your

107
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,909
distraction periods at home and at work

108
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,010
most of us allow ourselves to go online

109
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:14,979
at any moment and check our phone

110
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,840
whenever buzzes or dings but doing so is

111
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:19,659
training your brain to avoid deep work a

112
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,250
day full of unscheduled distraction is

113
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:23,770
training your brain to give in to any

114
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,779
and all distractions to build your

115
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,030
tolerance to avoid distraction you need

116
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:30,460
to place boundaries on your distract

117
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,980
have a notepad nearby and put down the

118
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,680
next distraction break you'll have hold

119
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,360
your focus until that time at first it's

120
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,250
going to be painful but remember that

121
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,640
doing this is effectively doing the reps

122
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,890
that build your ability to concentrate

123
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:47,620
second develop a rhythmic deep work

124
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:50,140
ritual Cal says the easiest way to

125
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,600
consistently start deep work sessions is

126
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:55,390
to transform them into a simple regular

127
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,370
habit the goal in other words is to

128
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,320
generate a rhythm for this work that

129
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:02,260
removes the need for you to invest

130
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,750
energy in deciding if and when you're

131
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,980
going to go deep Cal uses several

132
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,920
examples in the book to show that

133
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,720
scheduling chunks of deep focus in an ad

134
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,820
hoc manner doesn't yield much

135
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,430
productivity at all for people who are

136
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,230
not seasoned at doing deep work it's

137
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,780
best for them to have a reoccurring time

138
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:22,300
each day or each week to go into deep

139
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,610
work early morning is typically the best

140
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,780
time to do this because at that time you

141
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,330
typically don't have to deal with

142
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,920
incoming requests the research shows

143
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,140
that people new to deep work can

144
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,600
typically only do it for about one hour

145
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,400
and masters of deep work can typically

146
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,010
only hold their attention up to four

147
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,200
hours in intervals between 60 and 90

148
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:43,450
minutes throughout the day so the

149
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,250
ultimate goal of each day is to plant

150
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,350
deep work rituals throughout the day

151
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,690
with the ultimate goal of building up

152
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:52,600
the some of your deep work practices to

153
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,730
four hours a day the third strategy to

154
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,420
cultivate deep work in your life is to

155
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:00,160
have a daily shutdown complete ritual

156
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:02,590
sleep is the price we need to pay in

157
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,110
order to do deep work it's the interest

158
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:08,200
we pay on the loans of intense focus

159
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:10,540
required to do deep work to ensure that

160
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,160
we get adequate sleep and restore our

161
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,680
attentional reserves for the following

162
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,840
day Cal recommends that we incorporate

163
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,330
an evening shutdown into our daily

164
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,150
routine an evening shutdown ritual

165
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:25,030
involves making a plan to complete any

166
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:27,760
unfinished tasks goals or projects the

167
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,530
following day getting a series of steps

168
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,470
lined out for the following day is

169
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:34,240
enough to get items off your mind so you

170
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,970
can disconnect for the rest of the day

171
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,400
when you get things off your mind you

172
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:41,250
restore the ability to sleep well and do

173
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,680
deep work the following day

174
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,920
after Cal completes his plan for the

175
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,350
following day he will say to himself

176
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,420
shutdown complete it's pretty cheesy but

177
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:54,270
he says it's a great cue to unplug in

178
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,580
the end deep work is incredibly valuable

179
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,830
because it changes your brain and allows

180
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,590
you to produce innovative work that is

181
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:03,120
hard to replicate that was the core

182
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,920
message that I gathered from Cal's great

183
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,380
book Cal does a great job of teaching

184
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,750
deep work rituals and reducing the fear

185
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,040
of leaving shallow work behind I highly

186
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,750
recommend this book for anyone looking

187
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,480
